### Faceless Foreigner
The faceless foreigner:  
Stealing our jobs,  
Too lazy to work;  
A violent threat,  
A refugee in need;  
Their culture enriches us,  
but we cannot share it;  
Their back is hunched,  
From carrying all of our sins;  
But who are they really?  
The faceless foreigner.

### The Half-Blind Eye
It only sees what you show it, but all of that, it sees.

### Mummified Patient
A single person, mummified in either bandages or medical receipts. Are his wrappings keeping him alive? Or are they choking him to death? It's hard to say.

### Political Horseshoe
Extremists on the far right and far left are close to each other than either will ever admit to. We are all an Other to someone.

### The Twin Graphs
One slope heading ever-downward, the other ever-upward. We're not sure what it means, but we're all sure we recognize it from somewhere.

### The Buried Rifle
It seems that we're always half at war.

### The Void
What is defined by what it is not?
