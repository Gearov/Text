# Is it a game?

Often of video games, the question gets asked, 'is it art'? I tend to not find these questions very interesting, and it does not help that I have pretty much made up my mind on the matter (personal answer: yes). However, as of late, I have played a few games where I found myself asking, _but is this a game_? I was finding myself playing a game, enjoying the experience, but also realising that for whatever reason, it did not feel very game like. And I was thinking, man, is this a game. And then I realised I had no fucking idea what the definition of a game was.

Thankfully, somebody invented Wikipedia just for the express purpose of settling civilisation-defining questions such as these.
